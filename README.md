### *note*
You are now in the `snake` branch, which is developed based on [the codebase of previous art](https://github.com/zju3dv/snake). I would like to express my great gratitude to Sida's excellent work and the code open-sourced.



## Get started
1. Please follow the original [README.md](DS-README.md) for setup.
2. You may want to take a look at my training commands log inside [CMD.md](CMD.md), which is a bit messy though, to reproduce our results.
